# Plugins

We tried to rely on injected plugins to do the actual work.

While the configerus core is still pretty heavy, the plugins can be specified
at runtime allowing light weight injection of custom functionality.

We don't enforce any BaseClass or Interface on plugins, so a plugin developer
has to understand what they are expected to do, but overall it is pretty easy.

## Plugin factories

The core plugin module includes a Factory decorator class.  If you want to
inject a plugin, you usually wrap a plugin factory method with the Factory
decorator, specifying a plugin_id. Then you can use that plugin_id when asking
for a plugin, and your factory will be used to load it.

This registration is typically included as an import of the module/package.
The contrib sub-packages include the Factory decorations in __init__.py along
with the definition of the plugin_id as an exposed module constant for easy
access.

my/app/configerus/__init__.py
```
from configerus.config import Config
from configerus.plugin import SourceFactory

PLUGIN_ID_FORMAT_MYAPP = 'my-app'

@SourceFactory(plugin_id=PLUGIN_ID_FORMAT_MYAPP)
def plugin_factory_source_myapp(config: Config, instance_id: str = ''):
    """ create a plugin """
    return MyAppSourcePlugin(config, instance_id)
```

main.py
```
import configerus
from my.app.configerus import PLUGIN_ID_FORMAT_MYAPP

import my.app.configerus

config = configerus.new_config()
config.add_source(PLUGIN_ID_FORMAT_MYAPP).run_arbitrary_plugin_method()
```

## Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping allows for a more involved injection pattern.  It allows more
dynamic importing, and modification of a Config object.

Conceptually, you write an importable python distribution that has a setuptools
entrypoint `configerus.bootstrap` which refers to a boostrapping function.

setup.cfg:
```
[options.entry_points]
configerus.bootstrap =
    my_app        = my.app:configerus_bootstrap
```

my/app/__init__.py:
```
import {any modules which might run configerus decorators}

def configerus_bootstrap(config):
    """ bootstrap a config object """

    # run any arbitraty operations on a config object, such as adding config
    # sources, setting up validators/formatters, or even replace the object
    # all together, perhaps as a decorated object

```

main.py:
```
import configerus
from my.app import

config = configerus.new_config(bootstraps=['my_app'])
```

Note that the default `bootstraps` value includes some common bootstrappers.
You may want to keep those:
```
config = configerus.new_config(bootstraps=configerus.CONFIGERUS_BOOSTRAP_DEFAULT+['my_app'])
```
