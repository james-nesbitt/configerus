# TODO

List of things that are still to be done

## Improvements

## duplicate plugin adds

Plugin loading doesn't look for duplicates in some cases where it probably
should, such as formatting and validation.
Duplicates don't really cause any harm, but they are silly.

Strategies:

1. bootstrappers should check if a plugin exists before adding it.
2. validators - no good ideas here really

## Cycle detection in formatting / validation

We haven't done much work to detect cycles that may be cause by formatters or
validators when they try to process config.

## Features
