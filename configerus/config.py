class Config:

    Allows some sourced file based project configuration with some pattern
    templating and path set overriding.

    To allow easy separation of config into manageable files, all config is
    grouped into "label" strings which correlate to config files with matching
    names.
    Before accessing a config label, it has to be loaded, which you can do with
    the load() method.
    Then all get() calls use the most recently loaded config label.

    Templating: some string substitution can be done based on config values
        and some path keys. Templating options are based on a custom syntax

    Overriding: tell config about multiple paths in order of priority, and it
        will allow higher priority values to override lower priority values

    Dot notation retrival: you can treat your data as a tree, and config will
        allow you to retrieve tree nodes using a syntax where "." is a node
        label delimiter.
